                    Digital citizenship training gives me a lot of knowledge about how technology makes our
                     work easier.This helps me gain more confident on doing things using computers specially in ALS. 
                      I am able to teach my learners about digital topic, and give them enough knowledge that I gain
                      from this kind of training. I know some sort of things about computers but, its not enough.
                       That is why, I pushed myself to attend this training for me to have lots of ideas to become an 
                       effective teacher on digital skills on the next school year. This experience would the achievement
                        that I never expect. There are struggles, confuse, wondering by the new ideas, 
                   and also making new friends. Those memories means a lot to me, so I will keep it(char). 
                 I am proud of myself that I overcome all those circumstances and completed this training with no absences.
                  Thank you for the giving us the opportunity and the knowledge that you impart and motivates us 
                  to do things that beyond our limit.
